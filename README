Introduction
------------

This bootstrapper module/package allows us to either create new appengine projects (using a template)
or to bootstrap all necessary dependencies to our own internal libs and packages without having to 
go through requirements.txt


Usage
-----

Once an appengine project is checked out (the creator is coming soon), it must have a requirements.txt
and a package_spec.json.

The requirements.txt file tells where to get 3P packages that are available in the public domain.

The package_spec.json tells what packages/modules that we have written privately (and stored in bitbucket)
we need and are dependant upon.  To run the bootstrapper, do the following:

```
cd <appengine project dir>
<path_to_this_bootstrapper_project>/bin/bootstrap.py
```

That's it. 

If there are no errors, the following should happen:

1. Will ensure we are currently within a virtualenv.
2. Ensure that all requirements in the requirements.txt file have been installed into the proj_root/lib folder.
3. Ensure that all dependencies specified in package_spec.json have been installed into the proj_root/deps folder.
4. Ensures that the dependency source roots have been added to appengine_config.py
